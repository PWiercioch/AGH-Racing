# Airfoil
Simple Matlab script to compare different airfoils performance.

Created 06.2020

## Theroetical background
In order to enchance race cars performance aerodynamic devices are used. Main idea behind this practice is to generate downforce - a force pushing a car downwards increasing traction which allows to drive through corners faster. To achieve this airfoils are used, similar to those in airplanes with one major difference - they are placed upside down. 

The force is generated by pressure difference on both sides of an airfoil. The magnitude of the force depends on various factors, mainly: shape of an airfoil and angle of attack.

  <em>Different airfoil shapes and angles of attack</em>
</p>

Over 20 different airfoil shapes were analyzed using CFD. The aim of this script was to find which airfoil generates the most downforce in given angle of attack range.

## Setup
Script is ready to be run after cloning the repository.

At the begining of the file angle of attack range should be selected. User can also specify the number of top performing airfoils to find.

## Example of use

Lets find 4 of the best performing airfol in angle of attack ranging from 4 &deg; to 8 &deg;.

  <em>4 of best performing airfoils in range of 0 &deg; to 30 &deg;</em>
</p>

This shows that the performance of best airfoil in range of of 4 &deg; to 8 &deg; angle of atack drops after 10 &deg;.

In case of angle of attack in range 20 &deg; - 24 &deg; airfoil benzing 153-155 performs the best.
