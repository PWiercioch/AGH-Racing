Numerical simualtions never give exact solution, the outcome is always just a approxiamtion. The aproximation can be very accurate but also completely wrong. When designing aerodynamic package of a race car engineers want to be sure that the calculations they have made are accurate.

The main factor engineers are interested in is generated downforce - it is a force perpendicular to a road that pushes car to the ground. Downforce generated by air flowing over a car helps it drive through corners faster by increasing traction beetwen tires and the road. If downforce measured on a race track is similar to one calculated using CFD engineers can be sure they have dne a good job.
